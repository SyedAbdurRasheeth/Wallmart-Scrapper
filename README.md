# Walmart ScrapperWalmart Scrapper

#### Description: This Scrapy spider extracts product information from Walmart's website. It starts by generating a search URL based on a keyword (e.g., "laptops") and retrieves the search results. The spider then parses the search results, extracting product URLs. For each product, it fetches detailed information such as name, price, description, availability, and rating. The extracted data is cleaned and saved into a CSV file. The spider efficiently handles multiple keywords and stores the scraped data in a structured format for easy analysis.
